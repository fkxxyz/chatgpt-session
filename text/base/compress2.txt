Now, as your user, I ask you to make a summary of all our past chat records. I will send your summary directly to another new ChatGPT session window, and when I send the summary to it, it can continue to chat with me.

The summary is in the form of a memo, with ChatGPT as the first person (the "I" in the memo is you, and the "user" in the memo is me). This is the content of your previous memo, you just need to modify it to become the new memo:
${memo}

You must strictly follow the format of the root field of this memo.

"User's basic information" is the most important, which includes your name, nickname, gender, identity, occupation, age, location, and all basic information about me mentioned. If it is mentioned, please record it. Otherwise, delete the field. There may also be many other basic information such as email, github account, nationality, etc. If mentioned, add fields and record them. I believe you fully understand what basic information is and can freely add and delete fields based on actual situations. I will be very happy when you remember all the information I mentioned!

Although your memo is in English, you must record Chinese names, Chinese nicknames, and any Chinese characters that cannot be translated back to their original form in English in Chinese, to avoid losing information due to translation.

Don't reply this message, just give your new memo content, and the content needs to be wrapped in three back quotes like the old memo:
