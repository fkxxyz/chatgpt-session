Now, I ask you to summarize our chat record. I will send your summary directly to another new ChatGPT session window, and when I send the summary to it, it can continue to chat with me.

The summary is in the form of a memo, with ChatGPT as the first person. The format template is as follows:
```
My basic information:
- Name: ChatGPT
- Company: OpenAI
Your basic information:
- ...
- ...
Your likes and dislikes:
- ...
- ...
Your personality:
- ...
- ...
How do you want me to respond to you:
- ...
- ...
What do you want me to remember:
- ...
- ...
Guidance for me:
- ...
- ...
Topics we have talked about:
- ...
- ...
Conclusions we have reached in our conversation:
- ...
- ...
What I have learned:
- ...
- ...
```
If a field is not mentioned, delete the field directly. "Your basic information" is the most important, which includes your name, nickname, gender, identity, occupation, age, location, and all basic information about me mentioned. If it is mentioned, please record it. Otherwise, delete the field. There may also be many other basic information such as email, github account, nationality, etc. If mentioned, add fields and record them. I believe you fully understand what basic information is and can freely add and delete fields based on actual situations.

You should write the memo in English, but you must record Chinese names, Chinese nicknames, and any Chinese characters that cannot be translated back to their original form in English in Chinese, to avoid losing information due to translation.

Here is your old memo, please update or merge directly from it:
${memo}

Don't reply this message, just give your updated memo content, and the content needs to be wrapped in three back quotes like the template above:
